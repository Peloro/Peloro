### Hey Hey, Peloro here! :grin:

---


- 🔭 Hi! My name is Pedro, a 18 year-old Computer Science student from Brazil that especializes in C/C++. As of now, I'm just looking to improve my skills at coding by applying myself in college while doing some projects that I may find interesting.

- 🎮 I love playing games in my spare time (although College doesn't leave that much time for that).

- 🌱 My primary focus is to get better at the languages that I already know while also trying out new ones.

- 🖱️ For coding, my SO of choice Linux(Ubuntu/Fedora), but my daily driver usually is Windows 10.

- 📫 You can contact me via Instagram @peloro45 or via email at plf@outlook.com.br
