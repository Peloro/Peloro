- üî≠ Hi! My name is Pedro, a 21 year-old Computer Science student from Brazil. As of now, I'm just looking to improve my skills at coding by applying myself in college while doing some projects that I may find interesting. I have expertise and have worked in projects related to Computer Vision, Fullstack Developing and Database Manipulation.

-- I've worked in projects such as: 

- [Robot with Computer Vision and Speech Recognition](https://github.com/EnzoTM/R2_D2)

This project was developed collaboratively as part of an electronics course at university and showcased at the Undergraduate Research Symposium (SIICUSP 2023) at the University of S√£o Paulo.

The objective was to integrate machine learning capabilities‚Äîsuch as computer vision and natural language processing‚Äîinto a robot controlled by an ESP-32 microcontroller.

My primary responsibility focused on embedded software development for the ESP-32, using C++ to implement core communication and navigation systems.

- [FullStack Development of an Apartment Complex Store System](https://github.com/joaopgodoy/online_store_project)

This project was developed as part of an undergraduate course in Web Development, with the main goal of implementing a full-stack online store application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend, and EJS for server-side rendering on the frontend. The system supports features such as product listing, user registration and authentication, shopping cart management, and order placement.

One of the key takeaways from this project was gaining hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs, implementing session-based authentication, and managing a NoSQL database, as well as designing a modular and maintainable backend codebase.
